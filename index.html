It’s intended to be a CV but much more. A place where you can see more about the man you will work with.</p><p>I move between disciplines the way some people move between rooms: naturally, without noticing the threshold. I trained as an engineer in bioinformatics and modelling, driven by curiosity for how systems work—from cells to organisations. Along the way I discovered that I also needed space for art, movement, music, and the more human side of life. Both worlds have shaped me equally.</p><p>Professionally, I have worked in coordination, data analysis, and project support. I like clarity, structure, and turning complex processes into something workable. I enjoy building bridges between people who don’t usually speak the same language—scientists, managers, technicians, artists. That interface is where I feel at home.</p><p>Outside the strictly technical world, I’ve been a clarinetist since childhood, a dancer and choreographer during my years in Lyon, a music teacher in Mayotte, and a small creator of videos, performances, and random artistic experiments. I’ve also explored personal development through practices like Taichi, Qigong, the Enneagram, and Family Constellations, which have helped me understand myself and others with more nuance.</p><p>This website brings all of that together—my background, my projects, my interests, and the odd things I like to explore. It’s a place to gather everything I’ve done so far, and everything I’m still becoming.</p></section></article></div></main><div class=site-credits aria-label="Site credits"><p>Built with Hugo and Codex.
