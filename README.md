# My info
My cv but also a bit of other interesting bits about me that help decide whether I am a good working match or not

I'm going to use the oportunity to learn a bit about github actions and hugo to build sites.

So the main branch is going to contain the md files
Then upon commit, Hugo will run as a github action and it will create the static site in the pages branch
The git pages points at this branch and uses my domain as a custom domain.
